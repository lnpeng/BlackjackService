# BlackjackService
Blackjack web service is a SOAP-based web service that deals cards and evaluates hands.

# Description
Blackjack web service provides web methods to shuffle a deck of cards, deal a card from the deck and evaluate a hand of cards. The Blackjack web service uses an `HttpSession` object to maintain a unique deck of cards for each client application. Several clients can use the service at the same time, but web method calls made by a specific client use only the deck of cards stored in that clientâ€™s session.
